# Eco-Harbor: An Integrated Approach for Forest Fire Detection, Mitigation, Wildlife Relocation, and Tribal Alert Using Deep Learning and IoT

## Overview
**Eco-Harbor** is an advanced system designed to detect, mitigate, and prevent forest fires while ensuring wildlife relocation and tribal safety. The system leverages **Deep Learning and IoT** to provide real-time monitoring, early fire detection, and automated response mechanisms. This project has been **published in IEEE** at the *2024 1st International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, and Networking (ICAC2N)*.
