# Eco-Harbor: An Integrated Approach for Forest Fire Detection, Mitigation, Wildlife Relocation, and Tribal Alert Using Deep Learning and IoT

## Overview
**Eco-Harbor** is an advanced system designed to detect, mitigate, and prevent forest fires while ensuring wildlife relocation and tribal safety. The system leverages **Deep Learning and IoT** to provide real-time monitoring, early fire detection, and automated response mechanisms. This project has been **published in IEEE** at the *2024 1st International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, and Networking (ICAC2N)*.

## Features
- **Real-time forest fire detection** using AI-driven image recognition.
- **Wildlife relocation alerts** with high-frequency sound signals.
- **Tribal safety alerts** using automated voice notifications.
- **Automated fire mitigation** using sprinkler-based suppression.
- **Remote monitoring dashboard** for firefighting teams.
- **Data analytics for fire prediction and risk assessment.**

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning:** YOLO V8 for fire detection.
- **Microcontrollers:** ESP32, Arduino Uno, and NodeMCU for hardware integration.
- **Wireless Communication:** MQTT, Wi-Fi
- **Cloud Computing:** Real-time data processing and alerts.

## System Architecture
1. **Data Collection:** Sensors and cameras capture environmental data.
2. **Fire Detection:** AI models process images and classify fire risks.
3. **Automated Response:** Alerts are sent to authorities, and mitigation mechanisms are triggered.
4. **Wildlife & Tribal Alerts:** High-frequency sounds and voice alerts warn affected areas.
5. **Real-time Monitoring:**
